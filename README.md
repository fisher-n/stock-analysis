# Stock Analysis Using VBA

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help a client figure out what green stocks are the best investment options. By comparing the Daily Volume and Yearly Return of target stocks our client can compare the data and come to their own conclusions for investment. Analysis can be viewed here: [Green Stock Analysis]( https://github.com/fisher-n/stock-analysis/blob/main/Data/VBA_Challenge.xlsm)

## Results

Based on the analysis the results show that 2017 was a better year for investment than 2018. However, stocks ENPH and RUN produced a return for both years. Results of the analysis and runtime for both the original code and refactored code are below:
2017 GreenStocks original code:

2018 refactored code:

## Summary

The advantages of the refactored code would be that is has a faster runtime and is easier to read than the original code. The disadvantage would be the about of time it takes to refactor the code. They both produced the same output refactored and original just marginal differences in run time. Refactored code maybe more important with larger datasets than what we were working with but in our case the refactored is a bit unnecessary.
